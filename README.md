Jambo! and welcome! akilidca is a bot that regularly buys cryptocurrency at a specified interval. The word **akili** means brain or mind in Swahili. The objective here is to make it the most dca bot in existence that has as many advanced features as possible, but which at the same time can be used by your typical crypto trader with basic dca  experience

This, as with all projects was born out of frustration on the lack of features with "commercial" bots out there. They always missed that little tweak that in my mind would make things a lot more better, and hopefully profitable.

Let's get the usual out of the way...
